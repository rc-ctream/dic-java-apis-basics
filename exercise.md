### Scenario:
You work in a market research institute as a data analyst. 
Every day you are sent various profiles, the content of which is to be analysed by you. 
These profiles are stored in a public directory. 
The profile must be in a format specified by you so that you can read and analyse the content without further ado.


    # Header
    Name: <prename, surname>
    Date of birth: <date of birth>

    # Body
    <content>

#### Task:
Your task is to read the profiles programmatically and extract the names and dates of birth of the individual authors, and write it into a separate file (autors.txt). Imagine the directory of the profiles is called `profiles`. In this repository you will find a directory with two examples of proiles. You can use it for your exercise.

It is important that only one author is listed per line.
